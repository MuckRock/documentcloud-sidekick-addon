  SideKick is a machine learning tool designed to help you quickly test ways to
  categorize large documents sets based on semantics, apply machine learning to try to sort
  documents into one set or another, and get feedback on how well the model
  works. 

  # Step 1:

  Select a project on the left-hand sidebar before running this Add-On.
  If you need to, click *Cancel*, select a project, and start SideKick again.

  # Step 2:

  Use DocumentCloud's *Edit->Edit Document Data* feature to add a key
  value pair with the category you want, with about five examples of
  documents that match a category and five that don't. 
  For example, you might add a key of *linux* with five documents set to 
  *true* regarding posts on a Linux user group
  and you set five to *false* because those posts are on a cats group instead.
  Since *linux* is the value you're training on, set it as the
  *Value to Train* below. SideKick is a binary classifier â€” it will try to
  rank all documents on a spectrum from -1 to 1 based on how likely it believes
  the document is to be that value.
