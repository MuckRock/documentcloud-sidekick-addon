title: SideKick
description: >-
  SideKick is machine learning tool designed to help you quickly test ways to
  categorize large documents sets, apply machine learning to try to sort
  documents into one set or another, and get feedback on how well the model
  works. We're working on launching an improved, real-time graphical
  categorization tool, but in the meantime, this Add-On will let you get
  started.


  # Step 1:
  Select a project on the left-hand sidebar before running this Add-On.
  If you need to, click *Cancel*, select a project, and start SideKick again.


  # Step 2:
  Use DocumentCloud's *Edit->Edit Document Data* feature to add a key
  value pair with the category you want, with about five examples of
  documents that match a category and five that don't. For example, you might
  add a key of *Email* with five documents set to *True* and five set to
  *False*. Since *Email* is the value you're training on, set it as the
  *Value to Train* below. SideKick is a binary classifier â€” it will try to
  rank all documents on a spectrum from -1 to 1 based on how likely it believe
  the document is to be that value.
type: object
